## To install the package use:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("wilsonfrantine/ggbeast")
```

## Plotting Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots

You can just run the lines bellow, changing the words between quotes by the file path for your EBSP results.

```{r}
library("ggbeast")

p1 <- ggebsp("path_to_your_EBSP_run_log_file")

p1

```
## Customizing it

As any other ggplot2 object, you can customize it wherever you want.
To see how to change specificities as colors, time scales, Ne scales and how to plot many ebsp runs, please take a look on [this vignette](vignette/using_ggbeast.html)

or open from your R.

```{r}
vignette("using_ggbeast")
```

Have fun!
